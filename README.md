# LemonadeApp
Google Codelab

This is my solution from the Google Codelab for the Lemonade App in Android Basics with Compose. It's not really the solution proposed by Google but hey it works. Plus I added sound
to make it even cooler !!!

I'm still learning so I don't really know if my solution is efficient or not in terms of performance or whatever but for a small app like this I don't think
it makes any difference.

I don't really like to compare myself with other developers cause it makes me second guess myself but I know that I'm still learning...
